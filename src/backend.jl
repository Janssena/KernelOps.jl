The backend an array will execute on.

Plain `AbstractArray`s are host memory. Backend extensions add methods for their own array types
(`MtlArray`, and views of one), and the Reactant extension adds one for traced arrays that inspects
the compiling client — the only way to tell a CPU trace from a GPU trace, since the Julia type is
identical.

`x` as an array the backend's launcher can bind directly: a plain, contiguous device array.

A device launcher binds raw buffers, but callers hand it wrappers — a `view` of a fused projection's
output, a `reshape`. The default is the identity (host arrays, traced arrays, `nothing`). A backend
extension whose launcher needs plain arrays copies a wrapper here, once, on the device.
