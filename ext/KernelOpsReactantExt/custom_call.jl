    _embed_custom_call(call_target_name, operands, result_shapes; backend_config,

Emit a `stablehlo.custom_call` naming `call_target_name`, with the given `backend_config` string
attribute. The op itself carries no meaning tied to any one backend or dispatcher —
`"mps.metal_kernel_lib"` (below) is one Metal convention built on it, but a CUDA or ROCm custom
call, or a user's own, attaches through the same seam by passing a different `call_target_name`.

`backend_config` must be a StringAttr; XLA's custom-call plugins that key off JSON (as jax-mps'
does) expect it pre-serialised, not built from a NamedTuple here, since the JSON schema is entirely
the target's own convention to define.

`result_eltypes` is the element type of each result, one per entry of `result_shapes`; it
defaults to all `Float32`. The declared type IS the buffer the runtime allocates, so it must match
what the kernel writes: a kernel storing `Float16` into a result declared `Float32` fills half the
bytes and is read back as garbage, with no error.

`reverse`, given, is a VJP attached via [`_attach_reverse_rule!`](@ref) — see its docstring for the
calling convention. `label` only affects the generated reverse function's (gensym'd) name, for
readability in an MLIR dump; it defaults to `call_target_name` but is worth overriding when one
target name is shared by several logically distinct calls (`"mps.metal_kernel_lib"` dispatches
every kernel in a `.metallib` under that one target, for instance).

[`_embed_custom_call`](@ref) targeting `"mps.metal_kernel_lib"`, jax-mps' dispatcher for a named
kernel inside a pre-compiled `.metallib`. `layout` is the kernel's argument table in order, as
`(:in, i)`, `(:out, i)`, `(:out_zero, i)` or `(:bytes, payload)`. `:out_zero` is an output jax-mps
zero-fills before dispatch (`"zero_init"`), for a kernel that accumulates into it.

Two things are easy to get wrong and are silent when wrong: the `backend_config` JSON must include
`api_version = 1`, and dispatch must be by *threadgroups*, matching how the compiled kernel indexes
by `threadgroup_position_in_grid`.

    _attach_reverse_rule!(op, name, operands, results, vjp, active_operands)

Give a `stablehlo.custom_call` a reverse-mode derivative, by tracing `vjp` into its own
`func.func` and pointing the call site at it with `enzyme.reverse`.

Enzyme cannot see inside a custom call, so the rule has to be supplied from here. It lives on the
call site rather than in a registry keyed on `call_target_name`, because one target name can
dispatch several logically distinct kernels — `"mps.metal_kernel_lib"` names whichever kernel a
call's `backend_config` JSON points at, so multiple calls sharing that target name can have
completely different adjoints. `label` in [`_embed_custom_call`](@ref) exists to keep those apart
in the generated function name.

`vjp` is called as

    vjp(primal_operands..., primal_results..., result_cotangents...)
        -> one cotangent per entry of `active_operands`, in that order

`active_operands` is 0-based, and names the operands that can carry a gradient; anything left out
is a constant, which is what the boolean mask needs. The cotangent of every result is passed even
when it is meaningless — the `lse` residual's is a zero Enzyme materialises — so the argument list
stays positional.

Enzyme verifies this signature against the call site before it fires, so a mismatch is a compile
error rather than a wrong gradient. That check is the reason this is safe to write by hand.
