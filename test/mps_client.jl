# Locating the jax-mps Metal PJRT plugin, for the tests and benchmarks that need a Reactant client
# that actually traces to a GPU.
#
# Reactant's default client is CPU, and `backend_of` answers `CPUBackend()` for a traced array under
# it — so an op call takes the host path and the device-kernel route is untested unless a real Metal
# client is installed first. Anything exercising that path has to build this client explicitly.
#
# Set `JAX_MPS_PLUGIN` to the plugin's `libpjrt_plugin_mps.dylib` if it is not at the default path.
#
# No side effects on include: `mps_client()` is a function, and returns `nothing` rather than
# throwing when the plugin is absent, so callers skip cleanly on a machine without it.

# buffers between unrelated compiles. Must be set before the plugin creates its client.
